# My Professional Experience
![alt text](https://github.com/linayang-io/portfolio/blob/master/LinkedInProfile.png)

For almost 2 years, I recently had been working as a Marketing Analyst at [The Shed](https://theshed.org/), a new multidisciplinary arts and cultural center that opened in April 2019 in New York City, Hudson Yards neighborhood. I established the companyâ€™s first marketing data analytics strategies, creating dynamic dashboards and reports to analyze and accurately forecast ticket sales on a weekly, monthly, and quarterly basis and reported on digital marketing initiatives, including A/B testing for email campaigns and website attribution. I also helped with survey designs and analyzed qualitative and quantitative data to understand customer behavior and sentiment. 

I earned my certifications in Data Analysis and Data Science from [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/), where I have also acted as a teaching assistant for the part-time data analytics courses upon my certification completion. I am also certified in Google Analytics Individual Qualification (Completion ID: 9878272). 

# My Work Samples
### [Data Visualization with Google Data Studio](https://github.com/linayang-io/googledatastudio-worksample)
![Google Data Studio DB Demo](https://github.com/linayang-io/googledatastudio-worksample/blob/master/lyang_gds_demo.gif)

Using a open source data set from Kaggle.com, I explored and visualized the diversity and workforce demographics of 23 top tech companies. The original data set can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/silicon-valley-diversity-data). In addition to visualizing the data set, I wrote custom calculations and created a slider selector to measure gender disparity using the Gender Parity Index calculation as the benchmark.

Using open source 311 data from NYC Open Data, this dashboard I created in Tableau ranks each borough by highest volume of complaints and shows the geographical hot spots for each type of complaint. The original data set can be found [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9).

### [Data Analysis and Visualization using Google BigQuery, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly of Google Merchandise Store](https://github.com/linayang-io/python-ga-eda-worksample)

As a marketing and sales analyst, I am often tasked to offer descriptive analysis on website performance. Using a sample data set that contains Google Analytics 360 data from the Google Merchandise Store, I used Python and Google BigQuery to explore 3 months of the site's performance in 2016 in [Kaggle Kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/bigquery/google-analytics-sample). I used Google BigQuery to export table data based on different criteria and visualized and examined patterns using Python libraries.

### [Data Analysis using SQL](https://github.com/linayang-io/sql-worksample.git)
During my General Assembly certification course in data analytics, one of our projects was to run SQL queries in a PostgreSQL database that houses a [test flight](https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073326/https://testpilot.mozillalabs.com/testcases/a-week-life-2/aggregated-data.html) with customer surveys and usage analytics of Mozilla Firefox users. There were three tables we could call and join from for our analysis. Based on our findings, we were instructed to give recommendations on whether Mozilla Firefox should invest in revamping tabs or bookmarks in new versions of the browser.

### [Linear Regression and KNN Practice](https://github.com/linayang-io/ga-datr813_project3.git)
During the General Assembly certification course in data science, we were given guided prompts to build a linear regression model using open-sourced Boston housing data and a KNN model using an iris dataset. The link above links to a copy of the original General Assembly repo and Jupyter notebook exploring these algorithms. I received high marks from my instructors on this assignment.

### [Sentiment Analysis, Topic Modeling for Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/linayang-io/python-nlp-worksample.git)

For my final project in the General Assembly certification course in data science, I chose to showcase my skills in Natural Language Processing (NLP). In addition to exploratory data analysis, I used redacted, modified survey data from an employer to perform sentiment analysis and topic modeling. I used TextBlob to measure the sentiment polarity of the surveys, and I applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) clustering to a set of qualitative survey answers to isolate the survey feedback into different topics in an unsupervised way.
