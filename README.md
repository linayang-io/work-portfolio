# Portfolio
Hi. My name is Lina Yang. 

I am a data analyst with 3+ years of experience working in the start-up retail and arts & entertainment sector. I have experience working with different data structures and implementing data analytics processes and tools that have informed business decisions in customer experience, customer retention, sales planning, and marketing initiatives. I have a lot of experience building out from the ground up different reports and dashboards to report on different metrics and being a proponent in helping to build an active data culture within organizations.

# My Professional Experience
I am currently working as a data analyst at Starz, a premium cable tv network, working on subscriber analytics on their Starzplay international business. Prior to Starz, I worked at Ogilvy, an advertising agency as a digital analyst, and for almost 2 years, I worked as a Marketing Analyst at [The Shed](https://theshed.org/), a new multidisciplinary arts and cultural center that opened in April 2019 in New York City, Hudson Yards neighborhood. I established the company’s first marketing data analytics strategies, creating dynamic dashboards and reports to analyze and accurately forecast ticket sales on a weekly, monthly, and quarterly basis and reported on digital marketing initiatives, including A/B testing for email campaigns and website attribution. I also helped with survey designs and analyzed qualitative and quantitative data to understand customer behavior and sentiment. 

I earned my certifications in Data Analysis and Data Science from [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/), where I have also acted as a teaching assistant for the part-time data analytics courses upon my certification completion. I am certified in Advanced Google Analytics. (Completion ID: 9878272), and I am currently fulfilling my masters in data science and information remotely at the UC Berkeley School of Information. 

# My Work Samples
### [Data Visualization with Google Data Studio](https://github.com/linayang-io/googledatastudio-worksample)
![Google Data Studio DB Demo](https://github.com/linayang-io/googledatastudio-worksample/blob/master/lyang_gds_demo.gif)

Using a open source data set from Kaggle.com, I explored and visualized the diversity and workforce demographics of 23 top tech companies. The original data set can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/silicon-valley-diversity-data). In addition to visualizing the data set, I wrote custom calculations and created a slider selector to measure gender disparity using the Gender Parity Index calculation as the benchmark.

Using open source 311 data from NYC Open Data, this dashboard I created in Tableau ranks each borough by highest volume of complaints and shows the geographical hot spots for each type of complaint. The original data set can be found [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9).

As a marketing and sales analyst, I am often tasked to offer descriptive analysis on website performance. Using a sample data set that contains Google Analytics 360 data from the Google Merchandise Store, I used Python and Google BigQuery to explore 3 months of the site's performance in 2016 in [Kaggle Kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/bigquery/google-analytics-sample). I used Google BigQuery to export table data based on different criteria and visualized and examined patterns using Python libraries.

### [Data Analysis using PostgreSQL](https://github.com/linayang-io/sql-worksample.git)
During my General Assembly certification course in data analytics, one of our projects was to run SQL queries in a PostgreSQL database that houses a [test flight](https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073326/https://testpilot.mozillalabs.com/testcases/a-week-life-2/aggregated-data.html) with customer surveys and usage analytics of Mozilla Firefox users. There were three tables we could call and join from for our analysis. Based on our findings, we were instructed to give recommendations on whether Mozilla Firefox should invest in revamping tabs or bookmarks in new versions of the browser.

### [Data Analysis using Google BigQuery SQL, Pandas, and Matplotlib](https://github.com/linayang-io/sql-worksample3)
In my data science masters program at UC Berkeley School of Information, one of our projects was to run SQL queries on the Google BigQuery GUI interface as well as directly in the Linux command line to manipulate and fetch data to help answer prompted business questions. The project also included employing a Jupyter notebook to synthesis query results. This project was using a public dataset from the Bay Bikes Share.

### [Linear Regression and KNN Practice](https://github.com/linayang-io/ga-datr813_project3.git)
During the General Assembly certification course in data science, we were given guided prompts to build a linear regression model using open-sourced Boston housing data and a KNN model using an iris dataset. The link above links to a copy of the original General Assembly repo and Jupyter notebook exploring these algorithms. I received high marks from my instructors on this assignment.
